## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to analyze Amazon sales data to uncover valuable insights that can guide business decisions. We focused on understanding the revenue and profitability trends, as well as the impact of different factors on sales performance.

## Data Preprocessing

The raw Amazon sales data was initially collected and cleaned using Python. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, converting data types, and structuring the data for analysis. The preprocessed data was then used for further analysis and visualization.

## Analysis and Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- The top revenue-generating product segments were Cosmetics, Baby Food, Household & Office Supplies, with Cosmetics leading the pack.
- The highest revenue and profit were recorded in the year 2012, followed by a decline from 2014 to 2017.
- Offline channels contributed significantly to profit, revenue, and sales, especially from 2010 to 2015. Online sales gained prominence from 2016-2017.
- The months of February and November consistently saw the highest revenue and profit.
- The Sub-Saharan Africa region emerged as the most profitable and revenue-generating region, followed by Europe & Asia.
- Sales exhibited a peak in 2012 with maximum units sold and a decline in 2016 with the least number of units sold.
- Sub-Saharan Africa Region consistently outperformed other regions in terms of units sold, while North America recorded the lowest unit sales.

## Visualization

To provide a clear and intuitive representation of the analysis, interactive dashboards were created using Power BI. These dashboards allow users to explore the data visually, drill down into specific segments, and gain deeper insights.

## Tools Used
